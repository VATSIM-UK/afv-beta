    1) Download the standalone voice client from <a href="{{ route('client.download') }}">Here</a>.
       Run it and follow the instructions to setup AFV.<br />
    2) Download the latest Euroscope version from <a href="http://185.51.64.10/~euroscop/install/EuroScopeBeta32a20.zip">Here</a> and update your client.
       Remember to back your files up first just in case.<br />
    3) Download the shortcut <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/pq4gwibza71ruw5/EuroScope%20%28AFV%29.zip?dl=0"> Here</a>.
       Whenever you want to connect to the AFV Beta server, you will have to launch it with this shortcut.
       For connection to the live network, proceed as you normally would.<br />
    4) Connect to the AFV Beta server by typing the address (afv-beta-fsd.vatsim.net) into the server field or selecting the AFV-Beta server from the list (if available).<br />
    5) Run the standalone voice client alongside Euroscope and connect it as well.<br />
    6) That's it, you're now up and running. Enjoy!<br />

	<b><i>To get an ATIS station online, all you have to do is connect it to the network as you normally would,
	but without starting it on voice as well. In other words, you only have to connect the text ATIS and AFV
	servers will automatically read it on voice for pilots.</b></i>
