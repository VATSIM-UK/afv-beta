    A few sample ATIS bots have been setup to supply automatically generated ATISes. If a controller logs on then these ATISes get replaced with those of a controller.
    As the beta progresses, there will be a website for divisions to configure their ATIS bots with rules such as runway configurations or the possibility of uploading custom voice files.<br /><br />

    For now please use the reporting tool to report any weird phrases spoken by the ATIS bot, they have provided many hours of comedy audio during the development!
