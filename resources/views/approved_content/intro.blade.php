    The first rounds of Audio For VATSIM testing will be taking place on a standalone server to minimize disruption to other users of the network.
    This means that you will only be able to see controllers and pilots who are part of the AFV testing program, and <u>will not be able to use AFV on the live VATSIM network</u>.
